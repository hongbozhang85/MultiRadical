copy a *.log file with natrual orbitals information into this folder.
and then run the command:

./multiradical.sh

of course, you can also copy multiradical.sh and multiradical (two files in total) into the folder with *.log in which there are natrual orbitals information. and run the command: ./multiradical.sh


ATTENTION!!!
Only one *.log in the working folder is allowed!!! If there are more than one log file in the folder, there will be mistakes!
